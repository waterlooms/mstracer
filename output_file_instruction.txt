id  --  index
mz  --  mass to charge ratio of the maximal peak
rt  --  retention time of the maximal peak
z   --  charge state
isotope_num --  the number of isotopes
intensity_shape_score   --  coelution coefficient, measures how similarly the trails in a peptide feature change their intensities over RT
isotope_distribution_score  --  isotope shape coefficient, measure the similarity of the isotopic distribution of a peptide feature and its theoretical isotopic distribution
intensity_window_avg    --  the average intensity over the start and end retention time
intensity_area_percentage   --  the relative intensity in the surrounding area.
rt_start    --  starting retention time
rt_end  --  ending retention time
scan_num    -- the number of scans of a trail
intensity_sum   --  the total intensity of all isotopes in a peptide feature
SVR_score   --  the SVR score for conflicting isotope group removel, trained with SVR model based on isotope_num, intensity_shape_score, and isotope_distribution_score
quality_score -- the MSTracer quality score for ranking, trained with NN model based on isotope_num, intensity_shape_score, isotope_distribution_score, and intensity_area_percentage
